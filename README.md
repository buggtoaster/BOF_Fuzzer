# BOF_Fuzzer
This program will fuzz a running service to test for buffer overflow vulnerabilities by sending up to 5000 bytes to a specified IP address and Port.
The bytes will be sent in increments of 100 to give you an idea of how many bytes are needed to crash the program. Allowing you to find the EIP/RIP offset.
